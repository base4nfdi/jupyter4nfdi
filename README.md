# Jupyter4NFDI
Jupyter4NFDI aims to address the fragmented deployment of Jupyter Notebooks across NFDI consortia by offering a centralised service. This service will simplify access, improve user experience, and extend Jupyter's reach to a wider audience within and beyond the NFDI. It plans to integrate with IAM4NFDI for access governance and to provide access to HPC resources from GCS and the NHR Alliance. By supporting reproducible research and ensuring a consistent user experience, the proposal seeks to promote innovation and democratise access to computational research infrastructures.
